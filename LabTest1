    Write a program which requests a personâ€™s gross salary, deductions allowed 
    and rate of tax (e.g. 25, meaning 25%) and calculates his net pay as follows:
       
1.  Taxable income is equal to the gross salary minus the deductions.
2.  The tax is calculated by multiplying the taxable income by the rate of tax divided by 100.
3.  The net pay is calculated by gross salary minus tax.
Your program must print the gross salary, tax deducted and net pay, appropriately labelled.
