    A company preloads a presto card with $150.00 for its employees at the beginning of each month.
    The employees use this card to travel to and from work. It costs $2.05 for a one way trip to work.
    At the end of the month, the company uses the number of days an employee shows up 
    to work to calculate the remaining balance that should be on the card. 
    Write a program that requests the number of days an employee worked for a month and 
    calculates the remaining funds that should be on the card at the end of the month.
[insert the code for your solution here]
